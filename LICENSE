Preamble
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you are not obliged to surrender your freedom to do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that prohibit anyone from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on the same freedoms to the recipients that you received. You must make sure that everyone else also receives or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License, which gives you legal permission to use the software under certain conditions.

This License is your guarantee that you have the freedom to share and change all versions of a program. Consequently, you need to keep the copyrighted software under this GPL license so that everyone else also has that freedom.
